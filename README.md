# Tauri + React + Typescript

This app contains some simple utilities for interacting with the Solana blockchain. It is built with Tauri, React, and Typescript, and is intended to be used as a desktop app.

As of now, it only works on MacOS because it uses the MacOS keychain to store a wallet private key.
